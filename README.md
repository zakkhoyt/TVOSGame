Cursor based views for UIKit and SpriteKit

This app provides two view subclasses which render a cursor and fire a "tapped" block when the user clicks. One is a subclass of UIView (for UIKit apps) and the other is a subclass of SKView (for SpriteKit apps). 

The project demos both classes. To switch between them open Main.storyboard and set the initialViewController property of the corresponding viewController.
